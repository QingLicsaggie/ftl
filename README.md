flash translation layer with rewriting code

This is to verify that rewriting code can reduce writie amplification layer. 
Here rewriting code is general and ideal, and flash translation layer is just
the basic one (i.e., page based mapping, no wear leveling and just greedy garbage 
collection).  At this time, I can not obtain an analytic result for the write 
amplification.
